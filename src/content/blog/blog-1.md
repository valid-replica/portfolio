[Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) is my go-to font when coding. Although it supports ligatures, I prefer the classic programming runes.

# Terminal

- [VGN Dragonfly F1 MOBA](https://vgnlab.com/products/vgn-dragonfly-f1-series-wireless-mouse), had no problems with it so far. Budget wireless performance mouse, I really like it.
- [Aqual Control 2](https://shop.x-raypad.com/shop/x-raypad-aqua-control-ii-gaming-mouse-pads/) just works.
- [Maono AU-PM461TR](https://www.maono.com/products/usb-condenser-microphone-with-mic-gain-etc-maono-au-pm461t) is my mic. Works good enough, I just use it on Discord with my friends.
